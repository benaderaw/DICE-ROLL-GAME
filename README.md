# ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Game (Java OOP Practice)

Welcome to the **Dice Roll Game**, a simple two-player console-based game built in Java using object-oriented programming principles. 

---

## Game Rules

- A **random target number** is generated at the start.
- Two players take turns rolling **two dice**.
- Each player tries to reach the **target number** without exceeding it.
- If both dice roll the same number (a **double**), the total roll score is **doubled**.
- A player can choose to **roll** or **stop** on their turn.
- If a player **goes over the target**, they immediately lose.
- The player who hits the target **exactly** wins immediately and gets **100 bonus points**.
- If both players stop, the closest to the target wins. A tie results in no winner.
